Hello, I'm Deepak Shrestha.

##### 🎓 Education
Studying Computer Science at Lamar University. Skilled in Computer Vision, Data Science, and Software Engineering.

##### 🔍 Research Experience
At Lamar University, in partnership with Texas A&M Agrilife Research, I took on a computer vision project. I led the creation of a VGGNet-based CNN model, achieving a notable 93% accuracy in rice plant identification. This work is particularly aimed at benefiting precision agriculture.

##### 🖥️ Software Engineering
Before my research, I was a Software Engineer at Parsedom in Kathmandu. There, I architected and implemented a robust data extraction framework using Python and NodeJS, successfully managing data from over 200 distinct sources.

##### 🚀 What I'm Seeking
As I look ahead to January 2024, I'm excited to explore opportunities in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Engineering. I'm eager to bring my blend of academic knowledge and hands-on experience to a dynamic team.
